## READ ME 

* Honestly, I'm not an application/software  to have an about alongside the latest version to which I'm upgraded to.:P

* Nothing much to say.I'm jus writing so that the page looks full for now ;).

* Articles and major catchy contents here are inspired.

* As time passes i'll probably be more sensible enough to write something useful :D.

* Chill Maadi XD
